Code illustrating the use of the superlearner for time-to-event outcomes. Three methods are used: the discrete-time super learner of Polley and van der Laan (2011), the continuous-time super learners of Westling et al. (2023) and Munch and Gerds (2024,2025). The methods are applied to the rotterdam data set available in the 'survival' package in R. Methods are implemented using the packages 'superlearner' and 'survSuperLearner' and code from the 'joint survival super learner' (jossl) repository. By-hand implementations are also provided to clearly illustrate the steps involved.
